# Iot.Database Library
## Current Version: 0.0.9-beta

## Overview

Iot.Database is optimized for C# applications, offering a lightweight alternative to traditional databases. Iot.Database design based LiteDB for tables and TeaFiles for time series. 

## Versioning

- Version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch).
- X.Y.Z-beta (version under beta test).
- X.Y.Z-rc.1 (version under release candidate 1).
- NuGet package release after completion of rc release.

## Goals

- Easy to use
- Lightweight
- Encryption
- Quick and easy for IoT development and deployment

## Before You Continue

- This is a beta release. 

## Installation

To use the Iot.Database library in your project, follow these steps:

1. .NET environment compatible with C# .NET 7
2. Install Iot.Database NuGet Package (not available until version 1.0.0).

## Quick Start

### Initializing the Database
Iot.Database stores data in flat files. Make sure your application has write permission to the database path.

```csharp
using Iot.Database;

// Specify database name and path
var dbName = "MyIotDatabase";
var dbPath = @"c:\temp";

// Create an instance of IoTData
var iotData = new IotDatabase(dbName, dbPath, "encryption password");
```
This creates an empty database in your c:\temp directory

### Using IoTDB Table
#### 1. Create a public class for your data structure
```csharp
public class Friend
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
The above class is the model for your table.
All tables must have an ID property. The Id property must be of type: Guid, int, or double

#### 2. Access the table
```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Specify database name and path
    var dbName = "MyIotDatabase";
    var dbPath = @"c:\temp";

    // Create an instance of IoTData
    var iotData = new IotDatabase(dbName, dbPath);

    // Create a table with the class name as the table name
    var friendTbl = iotData.Tables<Friend>();
}
```
This creates an empty table in the Tables folder.

What if you also want to create a table called BestFriend?
Create another derived class from friend.

#### 3. Find and create a new record
```csharp
//check if the database has a friend name Bob
var friend = friendTbl.FindOne(x=>x.Name.Equals("bob", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
if (friend == null )
{
    //create a new friend
    friend = new Friend() { Name = "Bob" };
    //insert friend to database
    var id = friendTbl.Insert(friend);
    if (id.IsNull)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to insert.");
        return;
    } 
}

//display record
Console.WriteLine($"Success: Id [{friend.Id}] Name [{friend.Name}]");
```

#### 4. Foreign Key
```csharp
public class Address
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    [TableForeignKey(typeof(Friend), TableConstraint.Cascading, RelationshipOneTo.One, "Each friend only have one address." )]
    public Guid FriendId { get; set; }
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
}
```
The address class references the Friend table. 
IoTDB supports FK constraints, which allow you to cascade deletion and other actions. You can also set a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.

```csharp
// Address table
var addressTbl = iotData.Tables<Address>();

//check if the database has a friend named Bob
var address = addressTbl.FindOne(x => x.FriendId == friend.Id);

if (address == null)
{
    //create a new friend
    address = new Address() { 
        FriendId = friend.Id,
        Street = "123 Main St.",
        City = "Friend Town",
        State = "TX",
        ZipCode = "75001-0001"
    };
    try
    {
        //insert friend to database
        var id = addressTbl.Insert(address);
        if (id.IsNull)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Failed to insert.");
            return;
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Error insert address: [{ex.Message}]");
        return;
    }
}

//display record
Console.WriteLine($"Success: Id [{address.Id}] FriendId [{friend.Id}] Street [{address.Street}]");
```

#### 5. Foreign Key Constraint Error
IoTDB throws an error for all contraint errors.
```csharp
//This throws an exception because of the one-to-one relationship. Only one address is allowed for each FK reference.
//[TableForeignKey(typeof(Friend), TableConstraint.Cascading, RelationshipOneTo.One, "Each friend only has one address." )]
//public Guid FriendId { get; set; }
var address2 = new Address()
{
    FriendId = friend.Id,
    Street = "789 ABC Street",
    City = "Friend Town",
    State = "TX",
    ZipCode = "75001-0001"
};
try
{
    //insert friend to database
    var id = addressTbl.Insert(address);
    if (id.IsNull)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Failed to insert.");
        return;
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error insert address: [{ex.Message}]");
    return;
}
```

### Initialize Database Tables
Database initialization is highly recommended for IoTDB applications with FK. 
Initilize parent table first.
```csharp
iotData.Tables<Friend>();
iotData.Tables<Address>();
```

## Closing or Unloading IoTDB
Unloading or closing IoTDB is not necessary. The library handles closure and recovery automatically. However, incomplete or unwritten data will be lost if your program ends or crashes during a data write.


## Contributing

Creating a robust and user-friendly database equivalent library requires significant effort and contributions from the public. However, I do not plan to accept outside contributions during the initial beta testing phase.
